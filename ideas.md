如何让team work更加efficient是个重要问题。是什么因素让团队比单个成员力量之和更大？

例子：团队体育活动。

需要考虑的因素：the number of players, their roles, allowable contact between players, their location and movement, points earned, and consequences of violations.

团队的成功：

- whether the team has a diversity of skills (one person may be fast, while another is precise) 技能树茂盛
- how well the team balances between individual versus collective performance (star players may help leverage the skills of all their teammates) 乘数效应？
- the team’s ability to effectively coordinate over time (as one player steals the ball from an opponent, another player is poised for offense). 合作

目标：

- how the complex interactions among the players on the field impacts their success. 团队成功的原因是什么？
- examine the interactions that lead directly to a score, explore team **dynamics** throughout the game and over the entire season, to help identify specific strategies that can improve teamwork next season
- quantify and formalize the **structural** and **dynamical** features that have been successful (and unsuccessful) for the team 成功/失败的原因



题目：

- 建立network，研究network patterns (dyadic/triadic config), micro to macro, short to long.
- 量化成功团队合作的 **performance indicator**: diversity, coordination, adaptability, flexibility, tempo, flow. 

- inform the coach about the next season
- Can you generalize your findings to say something about how to design more effective teams?

quantitive indicators:
- diversity：？？
- coordination：借鉴paper1的network strength; algebraic connectivity
- adaptability：？？
- flexibility：？？
- tempo：借鉴50passes time
- flow：？？
